This project was created using SGDK in the Codeblocks IDE. It is designed for use on a SEGA Genesis console.

HOW TO PLAY -
Use the Dpad to move your racer. When going over hills, press A to perform a trick. The more tricks you perform, the faster you go. 
Avoid hitting tires, as they will bounce you around. The first player to complete 3 laps wins. 

This game features 4 different race tracks. In addition, each player has the choice between 6 different colours for their dirtbike.
